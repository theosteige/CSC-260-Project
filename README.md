Theo Steiger, Ian Schunk, Dennis Ken-Williams, Grady Bosanko
CSC 260 Team Grit Contract

What is our level of ambition for this project? 
We want to create an aesthetically pleasing implementation of the tool that our client (Professor Striegnitz) has asked for.

How will we communicate with each other? 
We will communicate via a group chat that was created this week and has proven to be effective since.

How often and where will we meet?
We will meet in the classroom 2-4 times a week at 5 o’clock, other than this we will meet on zoom regarding smaller meetings

Who is the product owner and the scrum facilitator?
Grady is our product owner and Theo will be the scrum facilitator. These will change accordingly from week to week.

How will we make sure that our meetings are productive?
We will communicate in our group chat before each meeting to briefly outline what we need to discuss and accomplish. This will save us time and prevent us from getting sidetracked with other goals or obstacles.

What will we do if some members contribute significantly less than others?
We will reach out to that person to offer them opportunities to contribute more but otherwise they just won’t have the satisfaction of being a part of the project as much as they could have been.

What will we do if some member violates any agreement in this contract? 
We can simply address it as a team and try to correct the violation to move forward with the project. If this doesn't work we will reach out to the professor.
